Test extensions and libraries
=============================

src/test/modules contains PostgreSQL extensions that are primarily or entirely
intended for testing PostgreSQL and/or to serve as example code. The extensions
here aren't intended to be installed in a production server and aren't suitable
for "real work".

Most extensions have their own pg_regress tests or isolationtester specs. Some
are also used by tests elsewhere in the tree.

If you're adding new hooks or other functionality exposed as C-level API this
is where to add the tests for it.
