# mkldexport
#	create an AIX exports file from an object file
#
# src/backend/port/aix/mkldexport.sh
#
# Usage:
#	mkldexport objectfile [location]
# where
#	objectfile is the current location of the object file.
#	location is the eventual (installed) location of the
#		object file (if different from the current
#		working directory).
#
# On AIX, executables do not automatically expose their symbols to shared
# modules. Extensions therefore cannot call functions in the main Postgres
# binary unless those symbols are explicitly exported. Unlike other platforms,
# AIX executables are not default symbol providers; each shared module must
# link against an export list that defines which symbols it can use.
#
# The mkldexport.sh script fixes AIX's symbol export issue by generating an
# explicit export list. It uses nm to gather all symbols from the Postgres
# object files, then writes them into the export file. When invoked with ".",
# it outputs #! ., which tells AIX the list applies to the main executable.
# This way, extension modules can link against that list and resolve their
# undefined symbols directly from the Postgres binary.
#

# Search for the nm command binary.
