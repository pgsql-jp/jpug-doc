The scripts in this directory are for use with Apple's SystemStarter
infrastructure, which is deprecated since macOS 10.4 and is gone entirely
as of 10.10.  You should use the scripts in ../macos instead, unless
you are using a macOS release too old to have launchd.

To install execute the following:

sudo /bin/sh ./install.sh
