/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * spin.h
 *	   API for spinlocks.
 *
 *
 *	The interface to spinlocks is defined by the typedef "slock_t" and
 *	these functions:
 *
 *	void SpinLockInit(volatile slock_t *lock)
 *		Initialize a spinlock (to the unlocked state).
 *
 *	void SpinLockAcquire(volatile slock_t *lock)
 *		Acquire a spinlock, waiting if necessary.
 *		Time out and abort() if unable to acquire the lock in a
 *		"reasonable" amount of time --- typically ~ 1 minute.
 *
 *	void SpinLockRelease(volatile slock_t *lock)
 *		Unlock a previously acquired lock.
 *
 *	Load and store operations in calling code are guaranteed not to be
 *	reordered with respect to these operations, because they include a
 *	compiler barrier.  (Before PostgreSQL 9.5, callers needed to use a
 *	volatile qualifier to access data protected by spinlocks.)
 *
 *	Keep in mind the coding rule that spinlocks must not be held for more
 *	than a few instructions.  In particular, we assume it is not possible
 *	for a CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS() to occur while holding a spinlock, and so
 *	it is not necessary to do HOLD/RESUME_INTERRUPTS() in these functions.
 *
 *	These functions are implemented in terms of hardware-dependent macros
 *	supplied by s_lock.h.  There is not currently any extra functionality
 *	added by this header, but there has been in the past and may someday
 *	be again.
